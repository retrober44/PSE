# Projekt Systementwicklung 

## What will you be building?
Over the course of this project, you will be building two multiplayer games using the Unity Engine and Amazon Web Services.  
The idea is to build two interfaces for these games: One for seniors, one for juniors.
The designers will therefore think about how to structure the games and their interfaces in a streamlined way for seniors,
like Lylu does for services like YouTube - while also designing an interface that a young person would expect and use.
The result will be a game that can truly be enjoyed by people of all ages - together.  

### The first game: "Schere-Stein-Papier-Schach (SSPS)"

## And what exactly will you be doing?
That of course depends on the group you join. We have three top-level organisational units:  
*Click your team's bullet point to read the team's specific readme file - but feel free to read the other teams' files as well, to know what you'll be integrating with.*

- [Backend](./docs/backend.md): You will be responsible for creating game servers, matchmaking and leaderboards using AWS.
  You will also be integrating networking into the frontend.
- [Frontend](./docs/frontend.md): You will develop the gameplay using Unity Engine, using the assets and structure created by the Design team. 
- [Design](./docs/design.md): You will come up with a design for this project as mentioned above: How should the games look for seniors and juniors respectively?
However, you will also be creating graphics for the games, i.e. draw the characters and animate them; choose sound files from existing libraries,
design the UI and design the flow of user interaction.
