# So you have chosen design.
Good choice. I'm sure you will make the games a lot more exciting to look at than this file. I mean, there aren't even headlines! Horrible design.

Since I certainly lack the knowledge and talent required for drawing things, I can't tell you anything about that.  
I just assume it will be helpful for you draw digitally and then use any 2D animation tool of your choosing to help you animate
what you've drawn.

I can tell you something about design, though: At Lylu, we design our UIs to be very simple.
We have one ground rule:  
**Only circular UI elements are interactive.**  
So, every button in Lylu is round.
This is very important to help seniors with the fear of breaking things, or the fear of triggering an action they didn't want to trigger.

We structure our UI using tiles. These tiles are reused everywhere in the app where they can be used. 
This means we have a component that, for example, displays video information,
which is what you'd expect after searching for a YouTube video. This will be reused in every feature that displays video information in any way.
A component used to display search results for wikipedia articles is used to display newspaper articles as well.
 
When designing the seniors' UI, you should take our core logic into account, as it has been proven to work.  

To see our basic design principles, you can check out our website. (www.lylu.de)
 
To get a really good look at Lylu's UI design, you can download the App, which is available on AppStore and Playstore (and just called "Lylu").
Note that Lylu is only available for tablets.
